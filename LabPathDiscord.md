## \#General pinned message

**__Welcome to the r/Lab_path Discord Server!__**

**This server is still under construction**, however any and all discussion related to the Lab Paths or the AFKArena Arcane Labyrinth in general is welcome!

Soonᵀᴹ I will put together a FAQ and (If necessary) a list of server rules. Until then, please abide by the general etiquette that would be expected anywhere else, and if you have any questions, feel free to ask them here!

## FAQ

### What is the Point/Benefit of the maps?

**tl;dr**: Having this map gives you a starting point for planning your lab run, and allows you to optimize your run a bit better.

---

I'll use the [23 Jan](https://www.reddit.com/r/Lab_path/comments/eslln7/lab_path_23_jan_20/) lab path for reference. Currently AFK Arena allows you to see two steps ahead. The majority of the time, this is decently sufficient to be able to maximize the run. However, sometimes it just might not give you enough information.

When I put this one up, I put up a [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Lab_path/comments/eslln7/lab_path_23_jan_20/ffaqdif/) about how this one sucked. The reason I did this (apart from the obvious terrible setup on the first floor) is because on the first floor, I saw the red for the 3rd move on the left, and figured I would want to get out of the box that the wagons made and would have a better chance to get more reds if they were available. Soon as I jumped on the second wagon, the red on the 4th move revealed itself. I continued to the first red I saw because I didn't want to waste two moves on wagons I knew I wouldn't use in that run.

Once I got to a brown on the 4th move, I could see the red on the 6th. It was right behind a fountain on 7 and a wagon was centered on 8. I decided not to go for it, because I didn't want to get trapped with the fountains on 7 and 9, wasting at least one more relic chance. As soon as I beat the brown flag on 6 in the center, the red flag on 8 revealed itself, along with the brown on the right. So my only options were 1 red and 1 brown, or fountain and red. I ended that floor only getting 2 reds. With this map, you can get 3 from that floor. 

Maybe that's not significant in the long run a lot of times, but any additional chances at some good relics can make or break a hard mode run.

> Your endgoal is to get as many lab coins as you get

### How do you map out both the Third floor and Hard Mode?

Two accounts.

### How do you manage to get through Hard Mode/Advice?

Luck, decent team comp, and relics... :but mostly luck:.

- Go for max red flags
- Pray to RNGesus for a good layout and good relics

### Why make a discord server for this?

Mainly? I'm bad at replying to messages/DMs on Reddit. I'm not always on, and I do get a notification on my phone, but 98% of the time I'm in the middle of something else, then forget about it.

The second reason was because I had a couple people reaching out to me about scripting to do with this, and wanted to coordinate with them. From there I just figured I might as well build the Discord server for the subreddit so it can serve a full purpose.

That's it, really. From there it was just a question of "Why _not_?"
