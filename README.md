# AFK Arena Arcane Labyrinth Auto Mapper

This Github Repo is still getting started. I'm working on getting all of the information and documents I've used so far into here for anyone who can use it, and intend to use it at least as a starting point for the scripting and discord information.

## Colors of Lab Path

The colors have been chosen purposefully, to allow everyone to be able to read the map with ease, including those who are colorblind. These are the hex values of the colors used:

- Boss: #fec80a
- Wrizz: #000000
- Red Flag: #f01b20
- Brown Flag: #c9a7a7
- Roamer: #654321
- Wagon: #212e8e
- Fountain: #99d7ea
- Hero Res: #fe3cbe
